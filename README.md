# Homebridge Virtual Button

This plugin let you create virtual buttons without any hardware behind it. It will also offer an http interface to toggle these buttons. This is nice to make all kinds of complex automations possible.

To toggle a button on the interface, call `http://homebridge.local:18082/toggle?name=NameOfMyButton`
